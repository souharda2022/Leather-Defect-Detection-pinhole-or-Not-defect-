# Leather-Defect-Detection-pinhole-or-Not-defect-
Modern leather industries emphasize producing
high-quality leather goods to maintain market competitiveness.
However, defects frequently arise during different stages of
manufacturing, such as material handling, tanning, and dyeing.
Manual inspection of leather surfaces often lacks objectivity and
consistency, prompting the adoption of machine vision systems
for automated defect inspection. To accurately identify defects
like folding marks, growth marks, grain off, loose grains, and
pinholes, which have ambiguous textures and fine details, effective
image processing algorithms are needed. This research introduces
a deep learning-based approach to automate the localization and
classification of leather defects using machine vision. Popular
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained with images
depicting various leather defects, and class activation mapping
is used to highlight the relevant defect areas. Networks such as
GoogLeNet, SqueezeNet, and ResNet demonstrate superior classification
accuracy compared to other advanced neural network
architectures.
